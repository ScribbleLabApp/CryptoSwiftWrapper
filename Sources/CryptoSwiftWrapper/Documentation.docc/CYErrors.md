# CYErrors

Defines error codes used by the CryptoSwiftWrapper module to indicate various types of failures during cryptographic operations.

## Overview

The CYErrors constants provide a standardized way to handle errors encountered during key generation, encryption, and decryption operations. These error codes help identify the specific issue that occurred, allowing for better debugging and error handling.

### Error Codes

#### `CY_ERR_GENKEY` (-100)

Error code indicating key generation failure.

#### `CY_ERR_ENCR` (-101)

Error code indicating encryption failure.

#### `CY_ERR_DECR` (-102)

Error code indicating decryption failure.

#### `CY_ERR_INIT` (-103)

Error code indicating initialization failure.
